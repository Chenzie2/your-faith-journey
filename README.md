## Design Philosophy

The themes are crafted to reflect different spiritual tones:

- **Dark Theme**: Uses deep navy and slate tones to create a peaceful, reflective atmosphere for nighttime or quiet moments.  
- **Light Theme**: Warm cream tones and crimson accents symbolize joy, renewal, and celebration.  
- **Typography**: Lora is used for its classic yet inviting serif style, enhancing readability while reinforcing timeless truths.

Both themes are designed with accessibility and clarity in mind.
