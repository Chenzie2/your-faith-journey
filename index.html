    <p>
      The world is broken, but there’s hope. God didn’t leave us in the dark. 
      Out of deep love, He sent Jesus — fully God and fully human — to rescue us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus lived the life we never could, died to take our place, and rose again 
      to give us new life. In Him, we are forgiven, restored, and made new.

    <h2>🗣️ Bear Witness</h2>
    <p>
      When the Holy Spirit comes upon us, it’s not just for comfort but for boldness.  
      You were empowered for a purpose: to share Jesus with the world.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <strong>“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you.  
      And you will be my witnesses… to the ends of the earth.”</strong><br/>
      — Acts 1:8
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This is the Great Commission; a command from Jesus to every believer.  
      You carry the hope the world desperately needs. Don’t hold it back.
